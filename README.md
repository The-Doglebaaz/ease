## The Problem

This problem was derived from our personal experiences at BITS Pilani. Whenever we wanted to play any sport at our campus' courts, we found that the courts were full most of the time and there was no method of verifying the occupancy of said court. The problem was further complicated when we required teammates or opponents for team games, but could not find any players that were free at the same time. Trying a new sport was extremely challenging as well, since we had no way to learn through experience due to lack of time on the court.

Ease is the one-stop solution to all of these problems.

Users can easily check the status of courts, inform other players of their playing times/plans, and find mentors to coach them through new sports. Ease is the perfect companion for players of all levels, from beginner to expert.

Ease is the easy way to take sports to the next level.
